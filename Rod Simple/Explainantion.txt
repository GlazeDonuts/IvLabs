In the correspoding code named "Rod Simple", I have used a very primitive approach.

I have simply calculated all the partitions of the given rod (treted as an integer) of length n.

Then I have found out the maximum value from all the given partitions using the price data provided.

(I have assumed price 0 for segment lenghts whose prices are not mentioned)
